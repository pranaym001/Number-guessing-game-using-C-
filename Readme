So, what’s going on with this C++ project? Let’s break the code down:
#include <cstdlib> and #include <ctime>: We need these for using the rand(), srand(), and time() functions.
srand(static_cast<unsigned int>(time(0)));: Initializes a random number generator with the current time as the seed value.
int secretNumber = rand() % 100 + 1;: Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
while loop: This keeps running until the user guesses the correct number.
Loop body: The program takes the user's guess and compares it with the secret number, providing hints of whether they are too low or too high.
Now, when you run this C++ program, it will ask you to guess a number to see whether it matches the randomly generated value. 
Based on your guess, it will give you hints until you guess it correctly. 
I really like this game, as it’s an excellent way to understand control structures and random number generation in C++.
As always, feel free to make as many changes as you want with this project. Maybe you want to get really wild and use floating-point numbers?
